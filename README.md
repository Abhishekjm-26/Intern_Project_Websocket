# WebSocket_Intern
WebSockets is an advanced technology that allows real-time interactive communication between the client browser and a server. It uses a completely different protocol that allows bidirectional data flow, making it unique against HTTP.

This was the project that I have done while going through my first paid Internship at Eakya Technologies being a Software Intern. 
The things that I have gone through while going through the internship are: 
-> Streaming Protocols.
-> Using Gstreamer.
-> Web Socket Programming Using Python & HTML.
It was a best experince going through the concepts & exploring idealogies & aesthetics of the company.
